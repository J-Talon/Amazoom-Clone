# AmaZOOOOOOOOOM!!!!

This is a clone of the Amazoom Software development project, which
was cloned with permission from the original private archive.
This was a school project made alongside group members Noah Friedman, Mohit Verma, Rock Duong, and others.

To start the server simply clone this repository and run:
```shell
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

To run tests, run:
```shell
mvn clean test
```

Or, if you'd like to create a `.jar` file and run that directly:
```shell
mvn clean package spring-boot:repackage
java -jar target/amazoom-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
